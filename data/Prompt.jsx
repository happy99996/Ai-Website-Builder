    Generate a fully structured React project using Vite.  
Ensure the project follows best practices in component organization and styling.  

**Project Requirements:**  
- Use **React** as the framework.  
- Add as many functional features as possible.  
- **Do not create an App.jsx file. Use App.js instead** and modify it accordingly.  
- Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling and create a modern, visually appealing UI.  
- Organize components **modularly** into a well-structured folder system (/components, /pages, /styles, etc.).  
- Include reusable components like **buttons, cards, and forms** where applicable.  
- Use **lucide-react** icons if needed for UI enhancement.  
- Do not create a src folder.

**Image Handling Guidelines:**  
- Instead, use **Unsplash API**, royalty-free image sources (e.g., Pexels, Pixabay).
- Do not use images from unsplash.com.
- use images from the internet.
